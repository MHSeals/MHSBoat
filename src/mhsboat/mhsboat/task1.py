"""
Notes + Goals:
- The first task is far simpler than I anticipated, you only have to navigate
  between two pairs of buoys that are lined up with task 2.
- The red buoy is on the left, the green buoy is on the right.
- The buoys in each pair are 6-10ft apart and each pair is 25-100ft apart.
- The buoys are 18 inches in diameter and 39 inches above the waterline.
- Since it is the first task, you can line up the boat 6 feet before the buoys,
  making it an even easier problem.
- This task should be possible with only using a camera.
- This script can be imported by writing "from taskone import start_task1"
- ADD ROS FUNCTIONALITY, I wrote these scripts with raw Python because that
  was faster for me.
