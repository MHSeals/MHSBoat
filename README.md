# Boat Scripts

This is still a work in progress. I am trying to experiment with the boat's configuration to make it easier to develop with. In order to install dependencies, run:

```
{
    chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
    sudo ./install_dependencies.sh
}
```

To run the scripts, simply run `ros2 launch mhsboat boat.launch.py`
